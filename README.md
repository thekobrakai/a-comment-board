I'm learnning JSP,as a practice, I implemented a comment board.

### The envrionment on my server:
* database: mysql
* http server: apache tomcat

### interface
You can preview the interface of the comment board on [http://guoang.github.com/a-comment-board](http://guoang.github.com/a-comment-board).

But `notice` that there is no server in the background,so you'll see nothing if you submit a comment.  All the comments you see on that page is static generated by HTML in the index.html.

If you really want to find out how this interface generated, see the codes on branch gh-pages.
